- all right. program is running with all coins. Next steps:
        a. when script is starting, it must close all opened positions
            it must start to work, only when position is closed
        b. get data about all trades
            think, it must be cvs file from DataFrame
            Symbol|Date_open|Price_open|Chanel_BTC|Slope_BTC|Current_chanel|Current_slope|max_price|min_price|Take_profit|Close_wallet|Date_close|Price_close|
        c. get information about BTC.
            If BTC ready to go in long or short, it must be fixed in flag and send in indicators functions.
            But only after getting data about all trades.
        d. enable trailing stop binance, when position is opened
        e. enable also all profit_list
        f. parallel work with same positions
        i. need more information about slope of BTC

- warning. Look at the trailing_price in the line 117. It must be differently for long and short positions.
